## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Don't say "I know nothing" in interviews (you clearly know a LOT!)
- ❌ Don't apologize for project limitations
- ❌ Don't apply without customizing resume/cover letter
- ❌ Don't stop after rejections (expect 70%+ rejection rate)
- ❌ Don't ignore recruiter LinkedIn messages

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By end of 2 months:
- [ ] 50+ applications sent
- [ ] 3+ interviews scheduled
- [ ] 1 offer received
- [ ] Portfolio with 2-3 strong projects
- [ ] 100+ LinkedIn connections

## 💪 Mental Game

**Remember:**
- You're NOT "knowing nothing" - you have a real ML project!
- Every rejection is practice for the next interview
- 2 months is achievable but requires daily effort
- Quality applications > quantity (but do both!)
